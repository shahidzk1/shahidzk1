### Welcome to my Github page

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I am a physics Ph.D. working and currently working as a postdoc on the AMS-02 nuclei data using machine learning algorithms. 
- I am learning cloud architecture and machine learning deployment on a large scale. Working on complex issues decreases the entropy of my mind. 
- I am interested in the use of AI in day-to-day life
