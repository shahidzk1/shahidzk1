### Welcome to Dr. Shahid Khan's Github page

- I am a physics Ph.D. and working as a postdoc at the University of Geneva. I analyze the AMS-02 nuclei data with machine learning algorithms such as Transformers, CNNs and XGBoost.
- Working on complex issues decreases the entropy of my mind. 
- I am learning cloud architecture and machine learning deployment on a large scale. 
- I am interested in the use of AI in day-to-day life
- You can contact me at shahidzafarkhan@gmail.com or shahid.khan@unige.cern

- This [code](https://github.com/shahidzk1/Machine_learning) contains a class to optimize the hyperparameters of various machine learning algorithms such as transformers, CNNs, MLPs, and XGBoost.
- This [folder](https://github.com/shahidzk1/Machine_learning/tree/main/Higgs_challenge) uses the above class in a notebook for the analysis of the Higgs boson challenge with various machine-learning algorithms
- This [folder](https://github.com/shahidzk1/Machine_learning/tree/main/Flowers_images_classifier) contains the classification of flowers with CNNs, again the class is used here

#### Course Teaching
- I am currently teaching a course on numerical analysis for bachelor's students as an assistant
- The course exposes the students to different analysis algorithms used in physics
  - Linear and multiple regression
  - Machine learning
- I have to prepare examples and exercises for the students
- The code of the exercises is available at [link](https://github.com/shahidzk1/Numerical_analysis/tree/shahid_version)
